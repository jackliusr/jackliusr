### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

In the past years before 2020, I was fascinated with right ways to do softwares and studied following enterprise application technologies. I am still interesting in those technologies. In the covid 19 pandemic period of last half of 2020, I reconsidered life, I shifted my interest into finance and studied accounting, [Investment Philosophies](https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/webcastinvphil.htm), [Valuation](https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/webcastvalonline.htm). When I was Asia Fusion Technology, I was interested in [startups](#startups) and followed them in 2-3 years. After above short detour, I am still passionate about IT and keep leaning and practicing IT technologies.
